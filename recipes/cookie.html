      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>Cream together butter and sugars until combined.</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.</li>

        <li>
          Roll 2-3 tablespoon (depending on how large you like your cookies) of
          dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your
          prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop to make
          your cookies).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out
